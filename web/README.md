# IronHand Web UI

This directory contains the React/Vite frontend for IronHand.

The UI talks to the IronHand REST API under `/api/v1` and is intended to be served by the Go server in production.

## User flow

- Register with a passphrase.
- Save the generated secret key.
- Login with passphrase + secret key.
- Optionally enable "remember secret key on this device" (off by default).
- Create and manage vaults; vault IDs are generated by the server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (or current LTS)
- npm 10+

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Run the Web UI in development

From this directory:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Run backend + frontend together (recommended for local development)

1. Start the Go backend from the repository root:

```sh
go run ./cmd/ironhand server
```

2. In another terminal, start the Web UI dev server:

```sh
cd web
npm run dev
```

3. Open:

- Web UI: `http://localhost:8080`
- API docs: `https://localhost:8443/api/v1/docs`

Note: the Go server uses TLS by default (`https://localhost:8443`), often with a self-signed certificate in local dev.

## Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

Output is written to `web/dist`.

## Preview production build locally

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Lint

```sh
npm run lint
```
